# CrewChiefV4-Changer
Simple script, monitoring game launches and (re)start CrewChiefV4 with correct Game

## Installation
Download asset from releases. Place anywhere and launch.

In case CrewCheifV4 is not installed in default locations, start CrewChiefV4-Changer using command line
argument `--crewchief-path "PATH_TO_CREWCHIEF_EXECUTABLE"`

Note: Enable `run immediately` from within _Properties_.

## Limitations
Not all games are supported, due to lack of `-game` command line argument.

Also, I don't own all games and do not know the executable to watch for. Please provide info for missing excutables.
